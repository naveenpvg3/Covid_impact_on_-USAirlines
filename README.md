The data comes from the U.S. International Air Passenger and Freight Statistics Report. As part of the T-100 program, USDOT receives traffic reports of US and international airlines operating to and from US airports. There are two datasets available:
Passengers: Data on the total number of passengers for each month and year between a pair of airports, as serviced by a particular airline.
U.S. International Air Passenger and Freight data are confidential for a period of 6 months, after which it can be released. As a result, quarterly reports and the year to date/calendar year raw data files available here will always lag by two quarters.
The following questions are the main subjects which this project focuses on:
This is a comprehensive dataset consisting of airline and passenger data pertaining to the U.S. International Air Traffic (1990-2020). This data when explored should be able to answer some interesting questions . One of them would be to create a list of the top 20 busiest airports in the US based on volume of International passengers. Additionally, the data should also be useful to understand how much impact the COVID-19 had on the volume of passengers and flights.
